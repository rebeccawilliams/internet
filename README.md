Internet Experiences
====================

This repo was created for a GitHub brown bag that collected [First Internet Experiences](https://github.com/rebeccawilliams/internet/blob/master/experiences.md) as a way to [Learn GitHub](https://github.com/rebeccawilliams/internet/blob/master/LearnGitHub.md).

New to GitHub and scared? This is a safe space. Sign up, click `Experiences.md` then "edit" to add your experience, and boom you're using GitHub. 

Feel free to edit: typos, ideas, and format here. Feel free to click "Fork" and edit your own version. Go wild.
